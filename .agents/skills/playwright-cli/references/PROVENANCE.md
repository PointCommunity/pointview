The upstream `SKILL.md` and its nine Markdown references are vendored under `references/`. The Versa entrypoint removes tool-specific `allowed-tools` frontmatter, pins the fallback invocation, distinguishes this CLI-specific workflow from the existing environment-neutral `playwright` skill, and adds authorization, sensitive-state, session-ownership, and artifact-handling boundaries.

The vendored files are unmodified copies from the pinned source. The new Versa entrypoint is an adaptation and is prominently identified as such here.
